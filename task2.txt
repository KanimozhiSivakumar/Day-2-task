DAY 2
Difference between document and window object
Window object
When JavaScript is executed inside the browser, the window object is the JavaScript Global object..
The window object represents the browser window.
The window object has many useful properties like the location object and the setTimeout function.
Since the window object is the Global object, ergo, it is the end of all scope chains, you don’t have to explicitly specify it when accessing its properties…
Instead of window.setTimeout, you can just write setTimeout
Same goes with document object instead of window.document, you can just write document object.
The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
Document Object
The document object is a property of the window object
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window.
The document and window are different objects and they have some different events. Using addEventListener() on them listens to events destined for a different object. You should use the one that actually has the event you are interested in. For example, there is a "resize" event on the window"resize" event on the window
